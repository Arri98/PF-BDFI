Dockerization and deployment of https://github.com/ging/practica_big_data_2019 for the final project of BFDI at MUIT in ETSIT 2021-2022

Execute installation.sh for automatic installation (sudo ./installation.sh)

Then you just have to press the Y key one time to allow the apt-upgrade and then you can chill for 20 minutes while this script installs docker,docker-compose
and creates the containers until it runs the docker-compose.yaml.

The upgrades attempted are:
   1. Dockerization of the different components of the architecture.
   2. Train the model with Spark Submit.
   3. Start the application using docker-compose.
   4. Deployed a VM at Google Cloud with this 3 previous upgrades.
   5. We tried to add Airflow but failed miserably.
