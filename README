Dockerization and deployment of https://github.com/ging/practica_big_data_2019 for the final project of BFDI at MUIT in ETSIT 2021-2022

Download the repo
sudo git clone https://github.com/Arri98/PF-BDFI

Move to the repo dir
cd PF-BDFI

Execute installation.sh for automatic installation 
sudo ./installation.sh

If you have docker and docker-compose installed run the following:
sudo ./installation.sh -s

Then you just have to press the Y key one time to allow the apt-upgrade and then you can chill for 20 minutes while this script installs docker,docker-compose
and creates the containers until it runs the docker-compose.yaml.

The upgrades attempted are:
   1. Dockerization of the different components of the architecture.
   2. Train the model with Spark Submit.
   3. Start the application using docker-compose.
   4. Deployed a VM at Google Cloud with this 3 previous upgrades. ( http://34.142.103.13:5000/flights/delays/predict_kafka )
   5. We added Airflow and imported the DAG but we failed to execute it. Now if throws an error saying that spark submit was not found but fixing this error still returns a null pointer exception when executing.
